Dear Veera,
Wish you a wonderful year ahead and lots of love best returns for the day! I cannot express my happiness to you today, for someone who is alexithimiyatic, I felt it will be better to write it down and start as early as today April 15 to make sure I actually am able to deliver this to you in the perfect manner I wanted it to be! You will always wonder what is wrong with this guy, always bugging me and over enthusiastic about my birthday? Even, I cannot explain why I am more excited than you for this, maybe because you are growing old but rather this is the day I truly take pride and joy to celebrate you not only as my best friend but rather as my brother! It has been such a rushed journey for me because I still cannot believe that college is finished, I still relive those moments I went roaming around Mantri Mall with you as a rookie fresher exploring life and not realizing that we were making memories, memories that hold special to me for my entire life!

Random Image-1 man, your photos are all over Google kya network engineer banega re tu :D


I want to celebrate this day because you existed in my life, and even though I am the one who showed you Naruto, my perspective to life changed a lot in all these years I spent with you and I will always cherish them as my most delighted times. I never was really the type of person who would have experienced friendship because I never got close to anyone really in life, people really do not care to talk to me unless they are having an exam the next day, making a project or need to cheat in exam and that really made me realize that I am not worth making friends with people around me. Pretty much even same in college life though even sometimes with you lol, yet there was indeed something rather different about you that compelled me to going out of my way to see you happier. I felt a sense of belonging with you all the time I spent in first year, as much insecure, rude, sometimes even sedimentary I am, I did not think that someone like you will accept me in your life. I found great joy in exploring a new independent life spending time with you right from all stupid youtube videos, movies, to roaming malls, you pushing me to watch a movie or me pushing you to attend a free C workshop all of which might not even have mattered for you, yet it was almost like a new life breathed into me where I realised that yes, people may have unfortunate circumstances but that does not mean that they cannot smile in the face of it. I regained back a smile that I believe I had lost long back when I was 8 and I always tried to thank you for that in my own weird ways right from forcing you to try some Delhi sweets, to treating you umpteenth times, and it just multiplied my joy to see you happy too! 


For me your first birthday, as weird it may be for you, will always be special because you acknowledged me and I will always be grateful to you for that hug as lame as it may sound to you! You have taught me more lessons in life than anyone of my friends, right from making me experience happiness, to drifting away in second year making me run after you so many times, what all stupid things I tried to win you back lol from helping you cheat in math exams, making Dhavan arrange place for your birthday,  to taking cabs all the way to your PG just to meet you haha, I was one big idiot thinking that all of it will matter to you, only to realise on 28th September, when you came to Manjuâ€™s birthday in hostel and ignored me all 12 hours with not even a word spoken, I realised having expectations from someone just spoils the friendship one of the most important lesson I learned the hard way. You made me learn a very beautiful thing which nobody else in our batch possesses, the power to be happy for someone who is happy, a very lame yet rare ability. I got to learn that my true joy was to see you happy, and you were way happier without me with others, and that made me learn to accept things the way they unfold and because of that I had a splendid second year identifying people who loved me, and most importantly exploring so many new things right from anchoring, debating to enjoying fun technical ideas with Tushar! I loved our trip to Kutch, might have bored you sometime sorry for that, but for me it was splendid right from the thrilling bus ride to enjoying time in dessert, and more importantly getting to spend some great memories with you again, it almost felt like a blessing and I remember hugging you forcefully at the end of the trip before my boarding, and will always be thankful for such a great time. It was a magical time indeed! I was delighted with those times! Indeed, I was happy seeing you happy for the rest of the year with you exploring a new chapter with your bike with your other friends and me exploring places playing Pokemon Go with Dishwosh, it was a wonderful time.

Random Google Image-2, man even my data security is breached I am realising this after web scraping damn!

I indeed was happy until you got typhoid at your flat, that was quite an unexpected downpour for me, as I had always thought you would be pretty glee always, but when I saw the situation, I almost felt like a failure, and guilt striked me back quite harshly. I felt like responsible for your situation and even though, I decided to spend more time with you even though I had to walk all the way to the flat which was initially quite difficult for me, but in a way seeing you smile I felt it was worth it and indeed I made multiple trips back and for first time in my life, I gave juniors to do assignments haha, that was very shocking for the junior as he never expected me to do such a thing, but lol it was not for me. I enjoyed my time with you there a lot, as I felt back a sense of belonging no matter even if the dinner was at Halli eating chapati palya on the streets, the company made all the difference. I remember a lot of people including some unexpected ones calling me chutiya for going all the  way walking to your flat, just to meet you lol, yet I am glad I never paid heed. Once I was satisfied that you were back to normal, your father had an operation, that was indeed a difficult phase for you, I am glad I was of some use to you. I remember, trying out my sample hypothesis experiment to check how many miles I can walk without fainting after a blood donation, and surprisingly I walked 8.5 km that day since I could not find any transport from Begur, haha! It was indeed fun! The other time I once came back to meet you in hospital, it was indeed fun too, talking with your mother, enjoying a meal and even more glad I was, that I spent a small but quality time with you on your birthday back then! I had never tried the photo cake service before ever lol, was curious as to how it will turn out and I was glad it was nice enough to make you smile! Those were one of the very best times indeed me hectified into 2 internships, still managing to spend time with you and even work on other projects I miss my prime multitasking days! Sometimes, I used to use meeting you as a reinforcement to complete projects so I can spend more time haha, I loved those times too! I was so happy to see you finally back to normal later with your dad in a better condition, and you being happy once again! Life has been a rollercoaster with you! Then, I saw you only during placements although you always left without talking yet it was still memorable, the day you got place I was rejoiced and felt so happy for you and even more fun was seeing shimoga roasted outside side entrance hahaha, even though you never met me that day or talked for months post that lmao, yet I felt relieved and happy. I was kind of shocked to see you on my birthday honestly never expected you to come since you quite did not remember it previous year to that haha, and yet it made me so happy to have you at that time it was a joy never felt before! Indeed, you taught me the best lessons of my life, for which I will always be not only grateful but also cherish your existence for a lifetime! Happy birthday to someone who used to be a friend long back, but now I proudly call him as my brother from another mother as! Wishing you lots of happiness, and love you 3000, I wanted to write this letter, yet thanks to the situation I am deprived in celebrating it with you right now that makes me sad, so I decided why not spend some time making it a website! I know you will have so many friends whose lives you lit up, right from being the popular kid at school to many special ones in college too with loads of wishes, yet I hope this brings a smile on your face and hope I was of some worth to you! 

# Happy Birthday Bro, Lots of Love and Wish you the most wonderful life on! Cheers to many more memories!
